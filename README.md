Hello!
      The function of the code is to use your api token and it will see all the accounts you have under the token and it will place the same order to all of the accounts. (RSA)
      I am doing this code in windows so if you were to do it on mac os do some changes to code such as removing the "{f}" but if your using windows your fine.
      The tradier.py will run the code so if you were to make it easy on yourself I would highly recommend using main.py some people prefer to use the tradier.py by itself so I left it alone
      If you use main.py it would change the code in tradier by accessing it and changing the places where it asks for ticker,quantity,side.
      MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE CONFIG.PY "ACCESS TOKEN = '' "
